puppet-applenetboot
===================

A module for configuring netboot on any Mac OS X 10.6/10.7 machine. (10.8 untested at this moment)

Many thanks to:
---------------
*Allister Banks (https://github.com/arubdesu) for the initial netboot config
*Gary Larizza (https://github.com/glarizza) for the guidance on making modules.
